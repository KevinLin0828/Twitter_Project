# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project #

The following project is to create a data set on Twitter. The project is to look for tweets
that are related to privacy(as in data from websites,software,etc) or trust(whether the person
accepts it or not). At the same time, detect their context. The context could be related to policy,
government, technology. Or it could be related to the number of retweets, followers, or tweets of
the person. Then, we would relate everything through sentiment analysis(whether itâ€™s positive or
negative). The intended audience of this project is, anyone who is interested in the correlation
between trust/privacy and context of the tweets, which are related to public policies, government
and technology. The audience would be presented with graphs or data set to visualize the
correlation.
